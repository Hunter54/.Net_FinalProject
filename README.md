# .NET-Project
This is the project for the .NET course. 
It uses Xamarin Android, and calls the api at http://paperquotes.com/ for quotes. 

The app allows for searching and saving of quotes provided by the API.
The provided apk inside the assignment has a valid token aleardy provided so it can be installed and used directly.

If you wish to build another version of the app, a valid api token must be provided inside Constants.cs file for the "ApiToken" variable otherwise the calls will return forbidden. I will provide the token in a different file inside the Assignment.
